### 2. Direct Messaging Between Users
- Users can send private messages to each other.
- Direct messages are only visible to the sender and receiver.

### 3. Role-Based User Permissions
- Two roles: **Admin** and **Member**.

  - Create and delete channels.
  - Moderate messages by deleting inappropriate content.
- **Members** can:
  - Send and view messages within permitted channels.

## Bonus Features

### 5. Voice-to-Text Transcription
- Users can send voice messages that are automatically transcribed into text.

- Transcriptions are stored along with the original voice message.

### 6. Styling Images Before Sending

- Enhances communication by allowing users to highlight important aspects of images.
- Provides a simple editing interface for quick adjustments.
